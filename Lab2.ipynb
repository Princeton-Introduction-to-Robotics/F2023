    "**If you received an unbuilt drone kit**: First, assemble your Crazyflie. Instructions are located [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-crazyflie-2-x/). **There is one caveat you should be aware of, however.** Instead of using the short connector pins, you need to use the longer set. This is because we are using the FlowDeck expansion deck, which will provide us with significantly more accurate state measurements. There are instructions for mounting expansion decks on the Crazyflie [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-expansion-decks/). We suggest you push the pins down until they appear on the other side of the flow deck to ensure a secure connection (the pins can be slid further through the black plastic on the connector but it may take some physical effort). Next, we need to install a few things so that you can set the radio channel your crazyflie uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you received a pre-built drone**: Please carefully read the instructions for building the drone [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-crazyflie-2-x/). Even though you have a pre-built drone, the instructions contain a lot of useful information about working with the drone (e.g., the correct configuration of propellers, how to attach the battery, how to switch the drone on/off, the meaning of different LED patterns, etc.).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that you have activated the mae345 conda environment. Then, follow the instructions for your operating system below. Note: Using a Mac (without the M1 chips) is probably the easiest option of the options. For this lab, prioritize setting up at least one person in your group with the software for running the Crazyflie. If you are able to get multiple laptops setup, that's great (but not critical at this stage in the course!). \n",

    "Run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`axbrew install libusb`\n",

    "\n",
    "`pip install cfclient`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**After installing these packages:** Run `cfclient` in terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows). For Linux, run the command `python -m cfclient.gui` in terminal and make sure your drone is on. If you receive an error regarding `pysdl2`, install the required packages as described [here](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/issues/592) based on your operating system (`pip install pysdl2 pysdl2-dll`). \n",

    "The `cfclient` software is a GUI for interacting with the Crazyflie. Connect the Crazyflie to your computer by USB and turn it on. Then, hit `Scan` in the upper left of the window and from the drop down menu pick `usb://0` and hit `Connect`. This uses the USB interface to connect to the drone. In the console tab (hit `View -> Tabs -> Console` if it isn't present), you should see `Crazyflie 2.1 is up and running!` followed by other information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing we have to do is set the radio channel the Crazyflie will operate on and will prevent other groups from sending commands to your drone (or your commands to their drone). Hit `Connect -> Configure 2.X`. Set the radio channel option in the dialog box that appears to **Ch.\\<your group number\\>**. Also make sure that the radio bandwith is 2 MBit/s (if it's set to something else, change it to 2 MBit/s). Hit `Write` (if you don't, this won't be saved). Now, change the value of the variable in the cell below to your group number."

    "- Sometimes the drone gets a poor initialization before flying. If it crashes before stabilizing at the hover point, it is unlikely your code is wrong. You may need to just run it again. It helps to plug in the battery/powering the drone on when it is flat on a surface.\n",
    "- **Turn the quadrotor on when it is plugged in to charge it!** It will not charge when it is powered off so that the onboard processor can monitor the battery and prevent it from overcharging.\n",
