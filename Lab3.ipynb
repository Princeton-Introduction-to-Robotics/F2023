    "# Implementing the A-star algorithm (50 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coding assignment, you will implement the A-star algorithm to search a maze. A maze is represented as an array of 0s and 1s. A cell in the maze is occupied if it is marked \"1\" and unoccupied if it is marked \"0\". The A-star algorithm will find the shortest path from A to B. The maze, along with the start and end positions are listed in the main() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few IMPORTANT notes:\n",
    "- A position in the maze is given by (x,y). As in lecture, x is the horizontal position along the maze, and y is the vertical position.\n",
    "- Indexing in python starts from 0. Thus, in the given maze, (0,0) represents the bottom left cell and (9,9) represents the top right cell. As another example, (9,0) represents the right most cell at the bottom. \n",
    "- For simplicity, we will make A-star find the shortest path in the maze from A to B. Thus, the cost l(x, x') associated with an edge between x and x' will simply be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a number of helper functions for you (see below) and have also completed some portions of the code. You will complete the portions marked \"TO DO\". The code will return a path from A to B that avoids the obstacle cells. It may be helpful to refer to the slides from Lecture 7 posted on Canvas; the slides contain pseudocode.\n",
