In this assignment, we define the _configuration space_ to be the set of robot configurations the robot can be placed in when we ignore obstacles. This is the definition we used in class. In addition, we define the _free space_ to bet the set of configurations that do not place the robot in intersection with one or more obstacles.\n",
